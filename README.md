# Hotel Managment

Hey there! I've developed a web application for hotel management. It's designed specifically for the hotel boss to handle various tasks effortlessly. With this application, the boss can easily check-in and check-out users, create new cabins, and set the breakfast cost. It also provides a comprehensive overview of each user's reservation details, including the chosen cabin, the price, and the reservation date. This application streamlines hotel operations and ensures efficient management of reservations. It's a great tool for the hotel boss to stay organized and keep everything running smoothly.
